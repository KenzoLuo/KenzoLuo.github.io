## 概述

- 介绍DSMC

> The direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) technique is a stochastic particle-based method for simulating dilute gas flow problems. The method was pioneered by Bird in the 1960s and has since become one of the most accepted methods for solving gas flows in the non-equilibrium Knudsen number regime.
